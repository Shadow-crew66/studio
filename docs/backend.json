    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. It uses path-based ownership for user-related data and denormalization to avoid complex security rules with `get()` calls.  The structure supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) by segregating data into collections with homogeneous security postures. Specifically, proposals and notifications are placed under user-specific collections to leverage path-based authorization, ensuring that only the intended user can access them. This eliminates the need for complex filtering in rules and maintains data integrity. The use of explicit IDs and timestamps enhances predictability and debuggability."
